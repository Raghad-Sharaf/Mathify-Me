# Mathify Me

ðŸ§© **Hackathon Project** â€” Built under a tight deadline

**Mathify Me** is a dynamic web app that transforms standard math word problems into engaging, themed puzzles tailored to user interests.

This repository contains the **frontend implementation** I developed as part of an accelerated Hackathon team effort, collaborating closely with fellow developers, AI engineers, and data scientists. I served as the **UX Designer Lead** and contributed all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the user interface.


## ðŸŒŸ Key Features (Frontend)

- **Responsive Input Form**

    - Users paste or type a math word problem and select a creative theme (e.g., Football, Space, Baking).

- **Themed Rewrite Engine**

    - Simulated AI rewriting with mock API calls that display a loading animation before showing the transformed problem.

- **Interactive Results Display**

    - Original and rewritten problems appear side-by-side in styled cards, with copy-to-clipboard and "Try Different Theme" actions.

- **Custom Toast Notifications**

    - Success and error toasts provide clear feedback for copy actions and rewrite operations.

- **Loading Animation**

    - Engaging spinner and floating symbols while awaiting rewrite results.


## ðŸ’» My Role & Contributions

- Led the **UX design** process, crafting wireframes and interaction flows for seamless user engagement.

- Built the **frontend** using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**, implementing:

    - Form validation and button disabling/enabling logic

    - Mock API integration with loading states

    - Dynamic DOM updates for results and notifications

- Ensured responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.

- Collaborated on UI polish and theming with the design team for consistent visual language.


## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vanilla JS, HTML5, CSS3 (no frameworks)

- Animations & Effects: CSS keyframes, flexbox, gradients
